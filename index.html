    <p>In the last year I have been looking to become more fulfilled outside of my mundane 9-5. Those efforts have lead me to delving deeper into things I enjoy, particularly the art of food preparation and wine. This site is dedicated to some tasty morsels of what I have learned thus far about the magic of pork and some of my favorite domestic and imported wines. Hope you enjoy browsing as much as I have enjoyed, simmering, searing, and tasting!</p>
