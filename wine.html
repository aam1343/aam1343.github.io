<div class="review"><p>Wine. There is so much to be said about it.  While the processes for growing, preparing and aging are pretty objective; the kind of wine you like is endlessly subjective, based on the preferences of your palate. </p>

<p>Wine has been around for centuries and has been perfected globally, with different varieties of grape, growing in various climates and regions, under varying whether patterns, and yet, it ha continued to have universal appeal. This magic elixir has a history of bringing people together in the spirit of joy, friendship and fellowship. </p>

<p>I began a love affair with wine, starting with sweet white and evolving to a preference of medium to full bodied reds, almost exclusively. I recommend <em>The Wine Bible</em> by Karen MacNeil; it is a fantastic, interesting and unpretentious reference book for ALL things wine.
